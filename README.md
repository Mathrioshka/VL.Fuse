An open source library for visually programming on the GPU, built to enable rapid workflows and modular approaches to accelerated graphics, logic and computation. 

It is built for use in [vvvv gamma](https://visualprogramming.net/) and follows it’s "always runtime" model allowing for fast design and programming work with no build or compile process in between you and your results.

As a community supported effort we make it to use in real world projects and aim to share the fruits of its research & development with our peers in the creative coding and generative design communities.

## Installing

The library is still in a preview state. Before installing it, please make sure you have the [latest vvvv gamma preview](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download).

- Go to vvvv gamma's _Quad menu_, then click on _Manage Nugets_ and _Commandline_. Once you have the command line open, type :

```
nuget install VL.Fuse -pre
```

- Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and wait for the end of the installation process

## Getting started
